## Data type conventions
- All booleans (is_current, is_finished, was_home, finished, started, is_captain, is_vice_captain) are INTEGER: 1=true, 0=false
- All costs and values (now_cost, value, bank, selling_price, purchase_price, player_in_cost, player_out_cost) are in tenths of £1m — divide by 10 to get £m (e.g. 65 → £6.5m)
- All stat columns (creativity, influence, threat, ict_index, expected_*) are REAL; counts (goals_scored, assists, minutes, etc.) are INTEGER
- kickoff_time and deadline_time are ISO 8601 TEXT stored in UTC

## Column glossary
now_cost: price in tenths of £1m (e.g. 65 = £6.5m)
player_history.value: player price at that GW, same tenths scale

creativity: FPL chance-creation measure (REAL)
influence: FPL match-impact measure (REAL)
threat: FPL goal-scoring-likelihood measure (REAL)
ict_index: composite ICT score ≈ (influence + creativity + threat) / 3 (REAL)
expected_goals (xG): predicted goals from shot quality/location (REAL)
expected_assists (xA): predicted assists from chance creation (REAL)
expected_goal_involvements (xGI): xG + xA (REAL)

expected_assist_performance (xAP): assists − xA (REAL)
expected_goal_involvement_performance (xGIP): xGP + xAP; overall over/under-performance vs expectation (REAL)
expected_goals_conceded (xGC): lower is better for DEF/GKP (REAL)
clean_sheets_per_90: clean sheets per 90 minutes played (REAL)
form: rolling avg pts/game over last 4 GWs (REAL)
selected_by_percent: % of FPL managers who own the player (REAL)

player_history.round: gameweek number (1–38)
player_history.was_home: 1 = player's team was the home side, 0 = away
fixtures.finished: 1 = match is complete; team_h_score/team_a_score are NULL if unplayed
my_team_picks.position: SQUAD SLOT number (1–15), not football position — 1–11 starters, 12–15 bench
my_team_picks.multiplier: 2=captain (2× pts), 3=triple captain, 1=normal, 0=benched
my_team_picks.gw_points: live/final FPL points for that player in that GW; may be NULL before first sync
my_team_gameweeks.bank: in-the-bank value in tenths of £1m
my_team_gameweeks.value: total squad value in tenths of £1m
my_team_gameweeks.event_transfers_cost: points hit for extra transfers (4 pts per transfer beyond free transfers)
my_team_gameweeks.active_chip: 'bboost' | 'wildcard' | '3xc' | 'freehit' | NULL
gameweeks.average_entry_score: average GW score across all FPL managers (NULL until GW finishes)
gameweeks.highest_score: highest individual GW score (NULL until GW finishes)

## Common query patterns

### Current gameweek
SELECT id FROM gameweeks WHERE is_current = 1 LIMIT 1;

### Player with team and position names
SELECT p.web_name, t.short_name AS team, pos.short_name AS position, p.now_cost / 10.0 AS price_m
FROM players p
JOIN teams t ON t.id = p.team_id
JOIN positions pos ON pos.id = p.position_id;

### My team picks for current GW (with player names)
SELECT p.web_name, pk.position AS slot, pk.multiplier,
       pk.gw_points, pk.selling_price / 10.0 AS sell_price_m
FROM my_team_picks pk
JOIN players p ON p.id = pk.player_id
JOIN my_team_accounts a ON a.id = pk.account_id
WHERE pk.gameweek_id = (SELECT id FROM gameweeks WHERE is_current = 1)
ORDER BY pk.position;

### Player GW history — double-GW aware aggregation
-- SUM stats per round to correctly handle double gameweeks
SELECT round, SUM(total_points) AS pts, SUM(goals_scored) AS goals, SUM(minutes) AS mins
FROM player_history
WHERE player_id = ?
GROUP BY round
ORDER BY round DESC;

### Filter players by football position
-- Use position_id on the players table, NOT my_team_picks.position
SELECT web_name FROM players WHERE position_id = 4  -- FWDs only

## Query pitfalls to avoid
1. ⚠ my_team_picks.position is the squad SLOT (1–15), not football position — join to players.position_id for GKP/DEF/MID/FWD
2. ⚠ player_history has multiple rows per round in double gameweeks — always GROUP BY round and SUM/AVG rather than selecting a single row
3. ⚠ All costs are in tenths — display as cost/10.0 to get £m values
4. ⚠ Boolean columns (is_current, finished, was_home, etc.) are INTEGER 0/1, not TRUE/FALSE
5. ⚠ team_h_score and team_a_score are NULL for unplayed fixtures — use "WHERE finished = 1" when you need scores
6. ⚠ gw_points on my_team_picks may be NULL if no sync has run yet — use COALESCE(gw_points, 0) when summing`;
